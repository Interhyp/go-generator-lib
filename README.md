# go-generator-lib

A golang library for generating files from templates. Can be used to scaffold application code.

See go-generator-cli for usage instructions, this is just a library that provides the rendering 
functionality, so it can be used from both a CLI and (potentially) a service.

## TODOs

* read generator-spec yaml from file
* read render-spec yaml from file
* validate render-spec against generator-spec
* write render-spec yaml with defaults to file
